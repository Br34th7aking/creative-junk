## The Three Door Dungeon  - Attempt 2 ##

You are the player who has to face three doors at every stage of the dungeon. 

#### Win conditions ####
- Clear stage 25 

#### Every stage ####
At every stage you have a choice to open one of three doors. If you open the right door, you get a chest with a chance to get an 
item. 

If you open the wrong door, you have to face a monster. 

#### Items ####
There are currently three items in the game. 

**Sword**: You can use it to kill the monster and advance one stage even if you open the monster door. 
**Shield**: You can close the monster door just in time to not get killed. However, after you close the door, a shuffling happens without you knowing it. Don't think that there will still be a monster behind the door you just opened.
**Golden Key**: Golden key will help you advance 5 stages without opening doors. 

#### End of Game ####
Your score will be calculated based on the number of deaths you had while playing the game. 
Each correct door opened gives 50 points. 
Each monster kill gives 100 points. 
Each shield save gives 25 points. 
Each death causes a -25 penalty on the points.
Each golden key gives you 500 points. 

Okay warrior! Get going!
