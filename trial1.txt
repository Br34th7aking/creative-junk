#### The Three Door Dungeon ####

Welcome to the Three Door Dungeon!

The player is trapped inside a dungeon and at every stage he faces three doors. He has to pick a door that he wants to open. If he 
picks the wrong door, he may get eaten by a vicious monster. If he picks the right door, he gets a treasure chest which may contain a 
golden key among other rewards. 

The golden key is a special item that allows the player to skip stages. There will be no golden key in the last stage. 
Currently there are three stages. The game will also track how many tries it took the player to win the game. 

Alright, let's get coding!

I got stuck at a number of places because I hadn't planned how the stages will be like beforehand. 

As I was coding, I made quite a few typos.I am making them right now as well. But the more important thing was that 
as I wrote more code, the game's idea started to evolve. I started to want different things for the different items. I should break down the checklist even further, in my next attempt. 

Okay, this is it for this one!
