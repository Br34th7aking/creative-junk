### The Three Door Dungeon progress ###

Version 1: trial1.py - This was mainly a failed attempt. A lot of changes came into my mind as I was coding the game. 

Version 2: trial2.py - This is a fully working game. You can keep playing till stage 25, at which you win the game. After that your score is displayed along with the number of deaths it took you to finish the game. 


Version 3: (Upcoming): Beautiful messages with different colors and ascii art.
