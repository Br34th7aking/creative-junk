### The Three Door Dungeon progress ###

Version 1: trial1.py - This was mainly a failed attempt. A lot of changes came into my mind as I was coding the game. 

Version 2: trial2.py - This is a fully working game. You can keep playing till stage 25, at which you win the game. After that your score is displayed along with the number of deaths it took you to finish the game. 


Version 3: (Upcoming): Beautiful messages with different colors and ascii art.



#### Javascript version 

Session #1: I was able to create the welcome screen. When the user enters his name and clicks *Start Game* he/she is taken to the main game screen. In the main game screen, I have only added the three doors so far.  In this session I moved out of my editor a lot as I had not collected all the resources beforehand and also because I didn't open multiple tabs for editing.
